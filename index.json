I am interested in the distribution of genetic variation (both neutral and adaptive) in natural environments, at different spatial and temporal scales (from Landscape Genetics to Phylogeography). To understand pattern and process, I use empirical data as well as spatial eco-evolutionary modeling. I received my Ph.D. in Biological Science from the University of Mississippi in 2020. The focal organism of my Ph.D. work was the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes\u0026lt;\\i\u0026gt;. I examined geographic and environmental influences at historical and contemporary timescales, including niche divergence of R. flavipes\u0026lt;\\i\u0026gt; from geographically overlapping Reticulitermes\u0026lt;\\i\u0026gt; species, and genetic divergence within the species. In addition to these historical eco-evolutionary processes, at the contemporary timescale I investigated how epigenetic mechanisms\u0026ndash;specifically, DNA methylation\u0026ndash;facilitate rapid responses to human-mediated disturbance of forest ecosystems. Finally, I developed a new landscape connectivity metric to help understand the impact spatial heterogeneity of environments has on biological diversity at multiple levels of organization, from alleles to communities.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"https://chazhyseni.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I have been doing research in the field of Population Genetics since 2006.
