I use a multi-disciplinary approach by borrowing techniques from spatial and multivariate statistics, as well as machine learning. I use both empirical data and spatial eco-evolutionary modeling to understand the distribution of genetic variation in natural environments. My spatial eco-evolutionary modeling research involves new ways to understand the effect spatial heterogeneity of environments plays on genetic variation and biological diversity at multiple levels of organization, from alleles to communities. Timescales of evolution is a unifying theme of my research. I have examined geographic and environmental influences on evolutionary change at historical timescales. At the contemporary timescale, I have investigated how epigenetic mechanisms�specifically, DNA methylation�facilitate rapid responses to human-mediated disturbance, both in forest and urban environments.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"https://chazhyseni.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I am an Evolutionary Biologist and Population Geneticist with 15 years of experience in molecular techniques and statistical analyses, including next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics.
