## Research Projects

### [Pond_Conn: Urban Pond Metacommunities and Landscape Connectivity](https://github.com/chazhyseni/pond_conn)
Investigating how landscape connectivity shapes invertebrate biodiversity in urban pond networks. This project integrates community ecology with landscape genetics to understand biodiversity patterns in human-modified landscapes.

### [MSconn: Multi-Scale Landscape Connectivity](https://github.com/chazhyseni/MSconn)  
A novel framework for quantifying landscape connectivity across multiple spatial and organizational scales, from genetic variants to ecological communities.

### [NALgen: Neutral and Adaptive Landscape Genetics](https://chazhyseni.github.io/NALgen)
Computational tools and workflows for distinguishing neutral from adaptive genetic variation across landscapes, with applications to conservation genetics and evolutionary biology.

### [Glacial-Interglacial Cycles and Genetic Structure in Eastern Subterranean Termites](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5hr7f31)
Phylogeographic analysis revealing how past climate changes shaped the genetic structure of termite populations in the Appalachian Mountains.

### [Forest Ecosystems and Epigenetic Variation in Eastern Subterranean Termites](https://github.com/chazhyseni/msaflp)
Investigation of how forest canopy cover and tree species diversity influence DNA methylation patterns in termite populations.
