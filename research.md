# Research

## Overview

My research focuses on understanding how spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity shapes genetic and phenotypic variation, and biological diversity across multiple levels of organization, from alleles to communities.

## Current Research

### AI/ML and Genotype-Phenotype Associations
Using AI/ML and statistical modeling (including large language models adapted for DNA) to shed light on the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic differences across vertebrates. 

## Research Themes

### Spatial Eco-Evolutionary Genetics
Integration of spatial statistics, landscape genetics, and evolutionary biology to understand how geographic and environmental factors influence genetic variation patterns.

### Epigenetics and Rapid Evolution
Examining how epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, enable rapid organismal responses to environmental change in both natural and human-modified landscapes.

### Phylogeography and Historical Biogeography
Using genetic data to reconstruct species' evolutionary histories and understand how past climate changes have shaped current biodiversity patterns.

### Urban Ecology and Conservation
Investigating how urbanization affects biodiversity at genetic and community levels, with focus on:
- Landscape connectivity in urban environments
- Metapopulation dynamics
- Urban pond ecosystems
- Environmental DNA applications

### Environmental Modeling and Biodiversity
Developing spatial and temporal environmental models to understand climate change impacts on genetic variation and biological diversity, including:
- Species distribution modeling
- Climate change vulnerability assessments
- Conservation planning for terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems
