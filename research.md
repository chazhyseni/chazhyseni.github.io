# Research

## Overview

My research focuses on understanding how spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity shapes genetic variation and biological diversity across multiple levels of organization, from alleles to communities.

## Current Research

### Stream Temperature Modeling and Freshwater Biodiversity
As an ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow at the U.S. Forest Service, I'm developing spatial and temporal models of stream temperatures to understand climate change impacts on crayfish community diversity in Mississippi streams. This work involves:
- High-resolution temperature monitoring
- Species distribution modeling
- Climate change vulnerability assessments
- Conservation planning for freshwater ecosystems

## Research Themes

### Spatial Eco-Evolutionary Genetics
Integration of spatial statistics, landscape genetics, and evolutionary biology to understand how geographic and environmental factors influence genetic variation patterns.

### Urban Ecology and Conservation
Investigating how urbanization affects biodiversity at genetic and community levels, with focus on:
- Landscape connectivity in urban environments
- Metapopulation dynamics
- Urban pond ecosystems
- Environmental DNA applications

### Epigenetics and Rapid Evolution
Examining how epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, enable rapid organismal responses to environmental change in both natural and human-modified landscapes.

### Phylogeography and Historical Biogeography
Using genetic data to reconstruct species' evolutionary histories and understand how past climate changes have shaped current biodiversity patterns.
