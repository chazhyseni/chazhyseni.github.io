      <description>I am an Evolutionary Biologist and Population Geneticist with 15 years of experience in molecular techniques and statistical analyses, including next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics. I use a multi-disciplinary approach by borrowing techniques from spatial and multivariate statistics, as well as machine learning. I use both empirical data and spatial eco-evolutionary modeling to understand the distribution of genetic variation in natural environments. My spatial eco-evolutionary modeling research involves new ways to understand the effect spatial heterogeneity of environments plays on genetic variation and biological diversity at multiple levels of organization, from alleles to communities.</description>
